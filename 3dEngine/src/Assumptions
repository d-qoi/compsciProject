Assumptions

Everything is going to be a column according to the rendering engine.
This can change later

The character is never going to be able to look up or down.
This can change later, but the rendering would have to be greatly extended.

The other entities are going to be rendered based on their center point, and as 2d sprites.
I don't what to think about what would happen otherwise.
